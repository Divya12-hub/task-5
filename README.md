# Task 5 â€” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
The aim of this task is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset using Python.  
The focus is on cleaning the data, handling missing values, detecting outliers, visualizing patterns, and generating insights.

## Steps Performed
- Loaded and inspected the dataset.  
- Cleaned data (handled missing values, duplicates, data types).  
- Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.  
- Created visualizations (histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmap).  
- Engineered new features and performed statistical tests.  
- Exported results, plots, and report.

## Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook (`Task5_EDA.ipynb`)  
- Cleaned dataset (`cleaned_data.csv`)  
- Figures (`/figures/`)  
- PDF Report (`Task5_Report.pdf`)  

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Missingno, Scipy, Statsmodels)  
- Jupyter Notebook
